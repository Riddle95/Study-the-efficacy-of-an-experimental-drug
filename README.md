# Study-the-efficacy-of-an-experimental-drug


The project applies machine learning techniques to evaluate the treatment result of an experiment drug, classify the patient profile, and predict the result.


5 data sets (df_A, df_B, df_C, df_D, df_E)corresponding to each of the 5 trials that were run were assessed.

Part 1, 2, and 3 were conducted by using R, and Part 4 was conducted by using Python.

Part.1. Evaluate treatment effect: the supervised learning technique, regression analysis, was used to evaluate the treatment's effectiveness. 

Part.2. Segment the patient profile: the treatment results from previous trials were evaluated to categorize the potential treatment results into 5 categories, and the patient profiles were classified into corresponding types by using PCA and K-means analysis

Part 3. Classify the potential type of treatment result: the treatment results of the new trial were classified into 2 potential categorises, including "flagged fr review" or "assigned to a clinical specialis for following up" by applying Random Forest and Logistic Regression

Part 4. Forecast the treatment results: apply neuron network to analyse and predict the treatment result
